## ZombieFeeding Contract
ZombieFeeding is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to adopt and feed zombies. It uses a token economy, where each zombie can be purchased for 100 ZombieFeedingCoin (ZFC) tokens. Zombies can then be fed other zombies to multiply their own ranks. The system is also designed to support future additions, such as incorporating additional NFTs or creating new opportunities for users to earn ZFC tokens.

## Getting Started
To get started with ZombieFeeding, you can either clone the repository and set up your development environment, or you can use the Rinkeby testnet version of the DApp.

## Prerequisites
 Node.js (version 8 or higher)
 npm (version 5 or higher)
 Truffle (version 5 or higher)
 Ganache CLI (version 6 or higher)
